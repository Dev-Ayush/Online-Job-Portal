It's a Classic ASP.NET Website of Online Job Portal just like naukri.com .
If talking about the designing part, then I haven't worked much on it as I decided to left that portion of the project for the last and complete the functionality part at first. So all the basic functions works just fine but it lacks an attractive look which I am sure I will complete and release the same via future update.

Talking about the project,
It has 2 major sections - JOB SEEKER and RECRUITER.
* Seeker can Register and Login into their account to view avalibale jobs and apply for the same too. Here for registration I have use "Wizard Control" of ASP.NET
* Recruiter can also Register and Login to view their Dashboard of Posted Jobs and can Edit,Delete or Add a new Job Posted via "Datalist Control". It also has section where recruiter can view the name and details of candidates who ahave applied for the same.


# For all Database connection and access, I have used Stored Procedure i.e. for registrating, Login verification and DataList records.
